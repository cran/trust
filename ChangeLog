 0.1   first version

 0.1-1   found typo/thinko in documentation
         also corrected bug found by Vinicius Melo <xvinnie@gmail.com>
         didn't give informative error message (garbage in, error message
         out!) when given infeasible initial point.  Now does.  Also
         help page changed specify initial point must be feasible and
         example given of error in examples.
